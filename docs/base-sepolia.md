No contract deployment is part of the web or indexer release process.
The current UI and event indexer remain wired only to the manual/cooldown GuardManager and its
legacy vault. The V2 factory and vault are recorded for typed access but are not wired into either
surface yet.

## Contract lifecycle

1. `createGuard` registers a Cooldown or StablecoinProtection guard with an approved asset,
   amount, cooldown, and release duration.
2. Only the owner can deactivate a guard, and only while it is Registered and unfunded.
3. The owner approves USDC and calls `fundGuard`. Funding is irreversible and sets
   `eligibleAt = fundedAt + cooldown`.
4. Once eligible, any account may call `executeGuard`. Execution creates a vault position for
   the guard owner.
5. The beneficiary claims the linearly vested amount from BaseProtectionVault.
6. Once the entire position has been claimed, anyone may call `completeGuard` to persist the
   Completed state.

The web simulates supported writes before requesting a wallet signature. It reads token decimals,
allowances, guard state, vault positions, claimable amounts, and completion state directly from
the contracts.

## Web deployment

Vercel is one frontend path. Import the repository and keep the project root at the
repository root. Add the five web variables listed in
`apps/web/.env.example`. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_AVERLOCK_INDEXER_URL` after the indexer has a public
HTTPS URL; leaving it empty keeps current-state pages usable and marks discovery/history as
degraded.

The root `Dockerfile` is an alternative standalone Next.js image and contains only traced
runtime dependencies in its final stage.

## Indexer deployment

Railway is recommended because the SQLite cursor needs a persistent volume:

1. Create a service from this repository using `railway-event-indexer.toml` or
   `packages/event-indexer/Dockerfile`.
2. Mount a persistent volume at `/data`.
3. Add every variable from `packages/event-indexer/.env.example`.
4. Verify `GET /health` and `GET /sync`, then set its HTTPS URL as the web indexer URL.

The indexer accepts exactly two distinct non-zero contract addresses. It starts at block
`45438094` and requests only the eight configured AVERLOCK event topics from BaseGuardManager
and BaseProtectionVault. SQLite uniqueness is `transaction_hash + log_index`; confirmations,
reorg replay overlap, bounded block ranges, pacing, and honest degraded states are retained.

## Read-only release gate

```bash
npm run check:base-sepolia
```

This verifies chain ID, bytecode, GuardManager-to-vault binding, approved USDC, token symbol and
decimals, contract version, and a deployment-block filtered log query. It has no signer and
cannot send a transaction.
